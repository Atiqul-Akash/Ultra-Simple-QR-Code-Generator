# Ultra Simple QR Code Generator

This is the Ultra Simple QR Code Generator with GUI! application built using Python and `tkinter`. I have also used chatgpt for some bug fixing and adding comments. 

It allows users to create customized QR codes by entering text, selecting error correction levels, and choosing colors for the QR code.

## Features

- Customizable QR Code generation.
- Options for box size, border, and colors.
- Multiple error correction levels.
- Simple and intuitive GUI.
